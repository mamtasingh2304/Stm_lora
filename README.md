# Stm_lora
in this project STM32 interface with Lora. lora point to point implement along with that mqtt also implemented on stm 
LoRa Module : -  Working on Point to Point Single Frequency. Both Gateway and Nodes  are tuned on that  frequency to communicate. Working in receiver mode to receive the data from the nodes in the farms.

      4.   STM 32  :-                  32 - bit Microcontroller 
                                                Vendor :ST 
                                                Series : STM32f103c8
                                                Processor : Cortex M3
                                


NODES :-

Lora Module :-            Working in Transmitter mode to send the temperature and             
Temperature Sensor :-    Digital temperature sensor .
                                     Protocol - One wire  .
                                     Application - To get the temperature of environment..
